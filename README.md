Hangman is a game in which you guess a variety of letters until you lose or guess the correct hidden word. Typically player that chooses the word to be guessed has to make sure it is difficult to ensure that they win, in place of this player there is a list of five possible choices selected at random from a selection of my favourite fruits! The person who will be doing the guessing is you!

This project aims to deveop my knowledge in python and to allow me to express my knowledge using OOP principles. The project contains `#One class` and will include several methods which will be listed below when the project is completed.

The program was created with and is executed by python 3 and can be run using the `#CLI` using ==python3 "Finished filename== as a command.

## Explain the steps the user takes after initialisation. Include Screenshots

-Step_1
-Step_2
-Step_3

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment 

### Set up Github
I had to create a new githubprofile that AiCore is able to access and review to ensure
my project work is being completed in a satisfactory manner.

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game  

In this step the variables for the game of hangman were set up and the random local package was imported additionally
a list of possible words to be guessed were addded!
Some functions have been created to check input characters to ensure they are alphabetical and that they are valid guesses. 

## Milestone 3: Check if the guessed character is in the word

At this milestone the inputs are checked in and then the code that checks these things are put into functions ready for use!

## Milestone 4: Create the Game class

Now it is time to introduce option oriented concepts into the program, and add in default parameters. Time to initialise the attributes.

## Milestone 5: Putting it all together

Finally code the Logic of the game, and document these steps with the OOP principles learnt from the Data Engineering Learning pathway with [Ai Core](https://www.theaicore.com/skills-bootcamp/landing). 

## Add Screen grabs to all of the milestones where applicable.
>[!NOTE]
>Project is now complete 

## How to run the project 
1.Ensure Python 3.11 is installed 

2.Download 

3.Run using either the `Python IDLE` or the `CLI`.  

#### Python IDLE
-If yo wish to run this using the Python IDLE. open the document using the Python IDLE and run using the F5 key once the "Hangman.py" file is open. After this another window should pop up in which the game will commence.

#### CLI 
-Open the Command line interface, after it is open type `_"python3 "_` and then the filepath to the downloaded `"Hangman.py"` document.
Once this is done then you will be able to play the game in the `CLI`

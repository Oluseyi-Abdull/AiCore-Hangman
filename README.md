Hangman is a game in which you guess a variety of letters until you lose or guess the correct hidden word. Typically player that chooses the word to be guessed has to make sure it is difficult to ensure that they win, in place of this player there is a list of five possible choices selected at random from a selection of my favourite fruits! The person who will be doing the guessing is you!

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment 

### Set up Github
I had to create a new githubprofile that AiCore is able to access and review to ensure
my project work is being completed in a satisfactory manner.

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game  

In this step the variables for the game of hangman were set up and the random local package was imported additionally
a list of possible words to be guessed were addded!
Some functions have been created to check input characters to ensure they are alphabetical and that they are valid guesses. 

## Milestone 3: Check if the guessed character is in the word

 

## Milestone 4: Create the Game class

 

## Milestone 5: Putting it all together


## How to run the project 
Ensure Python 3.11 is installed
